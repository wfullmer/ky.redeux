\section{Introduction}
\label{sec.intro}
The one-dimensional two-fluid model (TFM) is a four equation system (six including energy) which may become ill-posed as an initial-boundary value problem depending on the flow conditions and the specific constitutive modeling. Due to its importance in assessing and certifying the safety of nuclear power plants under accident scenarios \cite{trace, relap}, the conditional ill-posedness of the TFM is nearly as relevant today \cite{ahn17, relap7} as when the original discovery caused significant debate within the multiphase flow community and beyond \cite{gidaspow74}. Interested readers are referred to Lyczkowski \cite{lyczkowski10} for an overview or \cite{lyczkowski} for a detailed historical perspective on the ``spark that ignited the international controversy concerning the imaginary characteristics.''


Even when reduced to four equations by 1-D and isothermal assumptions, the TFM can be quite cumbersome due to the large number of constitutive equations required to model the expansive topology of gas-liquid flow regimes, e.g., see Sec.~1.3 of \cite{ishiihibiki}. Several simple models have been proposed to study the mathematical character of conditionally ill-posed systems of PDEs in greater detail, notably the works of Keyfitz \cite{keyfitz03,keyfitz04} and Kreiss and Ystr\"{o}m \cite{kreiss02}. Previously \citep{fullmer14}, the authors have investigated the nonlinear and chaotic behavior of the Nonlinear Example 1 of \citet{kreiss02}: 
\beqa
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + u \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} - c \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} &= \mu \frac{{\partial}^2 u}{\partial x^2} - b u  \\
\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} + \left(1 + \frac{v}{2}\right) \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + u \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} &= \mu \frac{\partial^2 v}{\partial x^2} - b v 
\label{eq.ky}
\eeqa
The system defined by (\ref{eq.ky}) is simply referred to as the Kreiss-Ystr\"{o}m (KY) equations in this work. An example 
In the original system \citep{kreiss02}, $c$, the key instability parameter, was fixed at unity and the linear sink, $b$, was set to a value of $0$ in the $u$-equation and $2$ in the $v$-equation. In our previous work \citep{fullmer14}, $c$ was only varied to qualitatively study the transition. The primary aim of this work is to understand quantitative measures of the attractor vary as a function of $c$--specifically the largest Lyapunov exponent, $\lambda_1$, and the correlation dimension, $d_C$, which were previusly only estimated for a single value of $c$. 


The remainder of this study is outlined as follows. Sections~\ref{sec.lsa} and \ref{sec.vn} review the linear stability of the continuous and discretized equations. In Sec.~\ref{sec.bif}, general results from the simulations are presented including global statistics and a bifurcation diagram. The largest Lyapunov exponent and correlation dimensions are calculated in Sec.~\ref{sec.lle} and \ref{sec.dim}.

\section{Linear Stability}
\label{sec.lsa}
%\subsection{Subsection Title}

Although the linear stability of the original equations have been reported previously \cite{kreiss02, fullmer14b}, it is worthwhile to review the analysis with particular emphasis on the maximum linear growth rate (for a given domain size) as a function of the control parameter. Due to the linear sinks in both equations, the steady solution of the homogeneous state is the trivial one, i.e., $u_0 = v_0 = 0$. 




In general, the growth rate is complex, $\omega = \omega_R + i \omega_I$, and the linear stability of the system is determined by the sign of $\omega_I$. 

\beq
\omega_I = -b \pm \sqrt{c} k -\mu k^2 .
\label{eq.omega}
\eeq
The critical (largest) growth rate occurs at $k^* = \sqrt{c} / 2 \mu$ and its value is given by
\beq
\omega^* = \omega_I (k^*) = \frac{{c}}{{4 \mu}} - b .
\label{eq.omega}
\eeq



The cut-off wavelength



LSA section goes here. Here's a test equation array. 






The two cut-off wavenumbers are coincident at $c = 4 b \mu$ which is exactly when the critical growth rate crosses the origin, i.e., $\omega_I^* = 0$. 

%\beqa
%\partial_{t}f + \mathbf{v}\cdot \nabla f + \frac{\partial}{\partial \mathbf{v}} \cdot
%\left[\left(\frac{\mathbf{F}_{\text{fluid}}}{m} \right) f \right] +
%\mathbf{g} \cdot \frac{\partial f}{\partial \mathbf{v} } = J\left[f,f\right],\nonumber\\
%\label{2.0a}
%\eeqa


Here's a test equation. 

%\beq
%m \dd \mathbf{v} =  {\mathbf F}_{\text{fluid}} \dd t=
%- \beta \Delta \mathbf{U} \dd t - \gamma \mathbf{V} \dd t + m \sqrt {\xi}  \dd \mathbf{W},
%\label{2.0b}
%\eeq



Maybe also include a VN analysis? 


A theoritical lower limit exists when $\lambda_0$ becomes equals teh smallest representable wavelength, however heruistic evicence shows that a sufficient ammount of resolution below the cut-off wavelength is required in order to provide sufficient dissipation to contain the instability. 

Compare $omega_I^*$ to that from VN and stop the analysis at 10\% error? 

$v^{n+1}_{i+1} - v^{n+1}_{i-1}$

\beqa
\frac{u^{n+1}_i - u^n_i}{\Delta t} + u^n_i \frac{u^{n+1}_{i+1} - u^{n+1}_{i-1}}{2 \Delta x} - c \frac{v^{n+1}_{i+1} - v^{n+1}_{i-1}}{2 \Delta x} &= \mu \frac{u^{n+1}_{i+1} - 2 u^{n+1}_i + u^{n+1}_{i-1}}{\Delta x^2} - b u^{n+1}_i  \\
\frac{v^{n+1}_i - v^n_i}{\Delta t} + \left(1 + \frac{v^n_i}{2}\right) \frac{u^{n+1}_{i+1} - u^{n+1}_{i-1}}{2 \Delta t} + u^n_i \frac{v^{n+1}_{i-1} - v^{n+1}_{i-1}}{2 \Delta t} &= \mu \frac{v^{n+1}_{i+1} - 2 v^{n+1}_i + v^{n+1}_{i-1}}{\Delta x^2} - b v^{n+1}_i

\noindent Contributions are to be in English. Authors are
encouraged to have their contribution checked for grammar.
American spelling should be used. Abbreviations are allowed but
should be spelt out in full when first used. Integers ten and
below are to be spelt out. Italicize foreign language phrases
(e.g.~Latin, French).

The text is to be typeset in 11~pt Times \hbox{Roman},
single-spaced with baselineskip of 13~pt. Text area is 17.8~cm (7
inches) across and 24.4~cm (9.6 inches) deep (including running
title). Final pagination and insertion of running titles will be
done by the publisher.

\section{Major Headings}
Major headings should be typeset in boldface, with the first
letter of important words capitalized.

\subsection{Subheadings}
Subheadings should be typeset in bold italics, with the first
letter of first word capitalized and the section number in
boldface.

\subsubsection{Sub-subheadings}
Typeset in italics (section number to be in roman) and capitalize
the first letter of the first word only.

\subsection{Numbering and spacing}
Sections, subsections and sub-subsections are numbered with Arabic
numerals. Use double spacing after major and subheadings, and
single spacing after sub-subheadings.

\section{Lists of Items}
Lists are broadly classified into four major categories that can
randomly be used as desired by the author:
\begin{alphlist}[(d)]
\item Numbered list.
\item Lettered list.
\item Unnumbered list.
\item Bulleted list.
\end{alphlist}

\subsection{Numbered and lettered list}

\begin{arabiclist}[(5)]
\item The \verb|\begin{arabiclist}[]| command is used for the arabic
number list (arabic numbers appearing within parenthesis), e.g.,
(1), (2), etc.

\smallskip

\item The \verb|\begin{romanlist}[]| command is used for the roman
number list (roman numbers appearing within parenthesis), e.g., (i),
(ii), etc.

\smallskip

\item The \verb|\begin{Romanlist}[]| command is used for the cap roman
\hbox{number list} (cap roman numbers appearing within parenthesis),
e.g., (I), (II), etc.

\smallskip

\item The \verb|\begin{alphlist}[]| command is used for the alphabetic
list (alphabets appearing within parenthesis), e.g., (a), (b), etc.

\smallskip

\item The \verb|\begin{Alphlist}[]| command is used for the cap
alphabetic list (cap alphabets appearing within parenthesis),
e.g., (A), (B), etc.
\end{arabiclist}
Note: For all the above mentioned lists (with the exception of
alphabetic list), it is obligatory to enter the last entry's number
in the list within the square bracket, to enable unit alignment.

\subsection{Bulleted and unnumbered list}

\begin{enumerate}
\item[] The \verb|\begin{itemlist}| command is used for the bulleted list.

\smallskip

\item[] The \verb|\begin{unnumlist}| command is used for creating the
  unnumbered list with the turnovers hangindent by 1\,pica.
\end{enumerate}

Lists may be laid out with each item marked by a dot:
\begin{itemlist}
\item item one
\item item two
\item item three.
\end{itemlist}

Items may also be numbered with lowercase Roman numerals:
\begin{romanlist}[(iii)]
\item item one
\item item two
    \begin{alphlist}[(b)]
    \item lists within lists can be numbered with lowercase Roman letters
    \item second item.
    \end{alphlist}
\item item three
\item item four.
\end{romanlist}

\section{Theorems and Definitions}
\noindent{\bf Input:}

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{theorem}
We have $\# H^2 (M \supset N) < \infty$ for an inclusion ...
\end{theorem}
\end{verbatim}

\noindent{\bf Output:}

\begin{theorem}
We have $\# H^2 (M \supset N) < \infty$ for an inclusion $M \supset
N$ of factors of finite index.
\end{theorem}

\noindent{\bf Input:}

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{theorem}[Longo, 1998]
For a given $Q$-system...
\[
N = \{x \in N; T x = \gamma (x) T, T x^* = \gamma (x^*) T\},
\]
and $E_\Xi (\cdot) = T^* \gamma (\cdot) T$ gives ...
\end{theorem}
\end{verbatim}

\noindent{\bf Output:}

\begin{theorem}[Longo, 1998]
For a given $Q$-system...
\[
N = \{x \in N; T x = \gamma (x) T, T x^* = \gamma (x^*) T\},
\]
and $E_\Xi (\cdot) = T^* \gamma (\cdot) T$ gives a conditional
expectation onto $N$.
\end{theorem}

\subsection{Proofs}
The WSPC document styles also provide a predefined proof environment
for proofs. The proof \hbox{environment} produces the heading
`Proof' with appropriate spacing and punctuation. It also appends a
`Q.E.D.' symbol, $\blacksquare$, at the end of a proof, e.g.

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{proof}
This is just an example.
\end{proof}
\end{verbatim}

\noindent to produce

\begin{proof}
This is just an example.
\end{proof}

The proof environment takes an argument in curly
braces, which allows you to substitute a different name for the standard
`Proof'. If you want to display, `Proof of Lemma', then write e.g.

\begin{verbatim}
\begin{proof}[Proof of Lemma]
This is just an example.
\end{proof}
\end{verbatim}

\noindent produces

\begin{proof}[Proof of Lemma]
This is just an example.
\end{proof}

\section{Equations}
\noindent Displayed equations should be numbered consecutively in
each section, with the number set flush right and enclosed in
parentheses:
\begin{equation}
\mu(n, t) = \frac{\displaystyle\sum^\infty_{i=1} 1(d_i < t, N(d_i) = n)}
{\displaystyle\int^t_{\sigma=0} 1(N(\sigma) = n)d\sigma}\,\,
.\label{this}
\end{equation}

\noindent Equations should be referred to in abbreviated form,
e.g.~``Eq.~(\ref{this})'' or ``(2)''. In multiple-line equations,
the number should be given on the last line.

Displayed equations are to be centered on the page width. Standard
English letters like x are to appear as $x$ (italicized) in the
text if they are used as mathematical symbols. Punctuation marks
are used at the end of equations as if they appeared directly in
the text.\footnote{Sample footnote}

\section{Illustrations and Photographs}
Figures are to be inserted in the text nearest their
first reference. Please send one set of originals with copies. If the
publisher is required to reduce the figures, ensure that the
figures (including lettering and numbers) are large enough to be
clearly seen after reduction.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics{lle.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{Labeled tree {\it T}.}
\label{fig2}
\end{figure}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=5in]{lle.eps}
\end{center}
\caption{The bifurcating response curves of system
$\alpha=0.5, \beta=1.8; \delta=0.2, \gamma=0$: (a)
$\mu=-1.3$; and (b) $\mu=0.3$.}
\label{fig1}
\end{figure}

Figures are to be sequentially numbered with Arabic
numerals. The caption must be placed below the figure. For those
figures with multiple parts which appear on different pages, it is
best to place the full caption below the first part, and have
e.g.~``Fig.~1 ({\it continued})'' below the last part. Typeset in
9 pt Times Roman with baselineskip of 11 pt. Use double spacing
between a caption and the text that follows immediately.

Previously published material must be accompanied by written
permission from the author and publisher.

Very large figures and tables should be placed on a separate page
by themselves. Landscape tables and figures can be typeset with the following environments:
\begin{itemlist}
\item \verb|sidewaystable| and
\item \verb|sidewaysfigure|.
\end{itemlist}

\section{Tables}

\noindent Tables should be inserted in the text as close to the
point of reference as possible. Some space should be left above
and below the table. Tables should be numbered sequentially in the
text with Arabic numerals. Captions are to be centered above the
tables. Typeset tables and captions in 9 pt Times Roman with
baselineskip of 11 pt.

If tables need to extend over to a second page, the continuation
of the table should be preceded by a caption, e.g.~``Table~1 ({\it
continued})''.

\begin{table}[h]
\tbl{Number of tests for WFF triple NA = 5, or NA = 8.}
{\begin{tabular}{l c c c c c}\\[-2pt]
\toprule
{} &{} &3 &4 &8 &10\\[6pt]
\hline\\[-2pt]
{} &\phantom03 &1200 &2000 &\phantom02500 &\phantom03000\\[1pt]
{\ninebf NC} &\phantom05 &2000 &2200 &\phantom02700 &\phantom03400\\[2pt]
{} &\phantom08 &2500 &2700 &16000 &22000\\[2pt]
{} &10 &3000 &3400 &22000 &28000\\[1pt]
\botrule
\end{tabular}}
\end{table}

By using \verb|\tbl| command in table environment, long captions will be justified to the table width while the short or single line captions are centered.
\verb|\tbl{table caption}{tabullar environment}|.

For most tables, the horizontal rules are obtained by:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
{\bf toprule} & one rule at the top\\
{\bf colrule}& one rule separating column heads from data cells\\
{\bf botrule}& one bottom rule\\
{\bf Hline} & one thick rule at the top and bottom of the tables with multiple column heads\\
\end{tabular}

\

To avoid the rules sticking out at either end
of the table, add \verb|@{}| before the first and after the last descriptors, e.g.
{@{}llll@{}}. Please avoid vertical rules in tables.
But if you think the vertical rule is a must,
you can use the standard \LaTeX{} \verb|tabular| environment.

Headings which span for more than one column should be set using
\verb|\multicolumn{#1}{#2}{#3}| where \verb|#1| is the number of
columns to be spanned, \verb|#2| is the argument for the alignment
of the column head which may be either {c} --- for center
alignment; {l} --- for left alignment; or {r} --- for right
alignment, as desired by the users. Use {c} for column heads as
this is the WS style and \verb|#3| is the heading.

\section{Cross-references}
Use \verb|\label| and \verb|\ref| for cross-references to
equations, figures, tables, sections, subsections, etc., instead
of plain numbers. Every numbered part to which one wants to refer,
should be labeled with the instruction \verb|\label|.
For example:
\begin{verbatim}
\begin{equation}
\mu(n, t)=\frac{\sum\limits^\infty_{i=1}1 (d_i < t, N(d_i)=n)}
{\int\limits^t_{\sigma=0}1 (N(\sigma)=n)d\sigma}.\label{aba:eq1}
\end{equation}
\end{verbatim}
With the instruction \verb|\ref| one can refer to a numbered part
that has been labeled:
\begin{verbatim}
..., see also Eq. (\ref{aba:eq1})
\end{verbatim}

The \verb|\label| instruction should be typed
\begin{itemlist}
\item immediately after (or one line below), but not inside the argument of
a number-generating instruction such as \verb|\section| or \verb|\caption|, e.g.:
\verb|\caption{ ... caption ... }\label{aba:fig1}|.
\item roughly in the position where the number appears, in environments
such as an equation,
\item labels should be unique, e.g., equation 1 can be labeled as
\verb|\label{aba:eq1}|, where `{\tt aba}' is author's initial and
`{\tt eq1}' the equation number.
\end{itemlist}

\section{References}
References cited in the text should be placed within square
brackets and stated as [surname of author(s), year of
publication], e.g., \cite{Golub89} and, with three
or more authors, \cite{Hall97}. If the reference reads as part of
the sentence, the square brackets enclose only the year of
publication, e.g., ``According to Golub and Van Loan [1989], \ldots''
